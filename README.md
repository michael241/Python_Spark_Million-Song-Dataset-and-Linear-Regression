# Python_Spark_Million-Song-Dataset-and-Linear-Regression
Synopsis: Exploratory analysis and linear regression modeling of a subset of the Million Songs Dataset.  
<br />
Motivation: Train and test a series of models including; Least Squares Linear Regression (via gradient descent) (Part 3), Least Squares Linear Regression with L2 regularization (via gradient descent) (Part 4), MLlib’s Linear Regression with Grid Search Packages (Part 5), MLlib’s Linear Regression with Grid Search Packages and two way interaction between features (Part 6).  Linear Regression is a quick technique to model complex datasets and these models exhibit use of this model.
<br />
Installation: sys, os, pyspark, numpy, matplotlib, and itertools.
